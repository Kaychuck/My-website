## Bio

Ikechukwu (Ike) Onwuka is a PhD Candidate at 
@FIUEnvironment who studies nutrient, sediment and water interactions in the canals of South Florida and America's Everglades. I use surrogate measurements to develop high frequency continuous water quality measurements and data science tools to detect patterns in aquatic systems to make inferences and predictions for water resource management. I am interested in using data science to connect water, aquatic sciences, climate change and food security to environmental sustainability. I am looking to collaborate with industry, academia, intergovernmental and global organizations, such as the United Nations.
